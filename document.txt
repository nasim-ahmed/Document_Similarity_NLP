Vehicles with no human driver on board were previously tested by a select group of Waymo customers, before the pandemic halted the service.

The driver-free cars will initially be available only to friends and family of those early Waymo adopters, but will extend to all app users within weeks.

The service comes two years later than originally promised.

The cars will be remotely monitored, with vehicle operators intervening in extreme circumstances - such as a road ahead being closed.
